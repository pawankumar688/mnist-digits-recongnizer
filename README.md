A deep learning approach for recognizing MNIST digits involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9). The model learns to recognize patterns in the images associated with each digit through convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Training involves minimizing a loss function using an optimization algorithm. The model is validated on a subset of the training set and tested on a separate test set. Once trained, the model can be deployed to recognize handwritten digits in new images.

## Purpose of this project:

Purpose is clear, we are leaving in day of A.I though It's not completely implemeted everywhere though it hase now it's significant and I want to explore this area to become well known, b/c you know if you have a better knowledge about a.i you will not get scared by it.

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm under graduat in IT I'm doing it from sindh  agriculture university form pakistan,
I'm very intersted in the filled of AI and it's subfilled Machine Learninig this project is my first project shows that what I have learned this few days, though it's not good as intermediate or master level even I can't compare it to other's and I'm stll learning, You may find some mistakes in my project and I Will be happy if you inform me about them but I'm still in leaning stage, And I will improve.
